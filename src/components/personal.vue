    <p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy a wide range of outdoors activities. Cycling on DFW mountain bike trails, early morning road biking. Rock climbing, camping & hiking.

        <h4>Video Game Server Owner/Manager <span>9/2014 - 4/2015</span></h4>
        <p>
            I founded and managed a community-based game on Garryâ€™s Mod within the DarkRP boundaries. With a team of developers and administration teams, we created custom content with a cops-and-robbers theme. The services were funded through a donation system we set up which granted donors additional content and personal perks. These services included two game servers, a 32slot VOIP, and Web hosting. I attribute the success of this community to the constant updates performed, user experience, and the fantastic team of administrators and developers.

        <h4>Ice Hockey Official, Dallas Metroplex <span>2010 - 2015</span></h4>
        <p>
          As the Official I enforced over 250 rules of the game. My calm demeanor and ability to make quick decisions under pressure quickly earned me the distinction of being a top level referee within the Dallas metroplex. At the height of my refereeing career, I was honored to be asked to work the pre-season game of the Dallas Stars NHL team.
