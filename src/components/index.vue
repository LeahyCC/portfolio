      <h4>Web Developer</h4>
      <h5>EMP Marketing <span>January '18 - Current</span></h5>
      <p>
        Contracted by EMP Marketing to develop a Website for loan lead generation. Using vue-cli and Google Firebase, I created SPA that submits to a real-time database and is accessible only through authentication login-page. There you can retreive all submitted information, edit and delete submissions. The forms are dynamic based off user selection. Site is currently under quality control and will be going live within the next couple weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the SPA forms, I built a blog using Wix site generator to serve as a SEO landing-page. I used Wix for a user freindly platform for non-tech people to have acecess to adding, and modifying the blog entries.
